# Buffon's Needle Simulator (MATLAB GUI)

This project is a MATLAB GUI application that simulates and visualises Buffon's Needle Experiment which is a classic probability problem that can be used to estimate the value of Ï€.

The GUI allows you to specify how many needles are randomly dropped onto a specified number of floorboards the program then simulates and drops virtual "needles" onto a lined plane, track how many cross a line, and compare the experimental probability with the theoretical probability.

## The more needles or squares dropped, the more accurately the value of PI is relflected
